functionality

1) the program computes z = (x*y)-(x/2) = 14

2) the program finds the largest element in the integer array (432) and prints it out

3) the program increments x from 100 to 999 and prints out if at the end of the loop if eax = x (which doesnt happen)

4) the main program loops incrementing z until z >= y then it calls proc1 which does multiple sets of while loops where the number of times that the program loops depends on the arguments passed in.  After all the pass throughs the program outputs 50 as the result.
